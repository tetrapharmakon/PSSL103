{"name":"Fernando Lucatelli Nunes","title":"Biadjoint Triangles and Applications","abstract":"In this talk, we will prove the biadjoint triangle theorem as a consequence of a basic theorem on (pseudo)premonadic (pseudo)functors and Descent. If time permits, we will talk about applications, such as the construction of pointwise pseudo-Kan extensions. This work was part of my PhD studies under supervision of Maria Manuel Clementino at University of Coimbra.","email":"fernandolucatelli@gmail.com","arrival":"2018-04-05","departure":"2018-04-09"}
