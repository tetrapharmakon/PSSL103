Dear category theorists,

We are pleased to announce that the 103rd Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will be held on the weekend of 7/8 April 2018 in Brno, Czech Republic. On April 6 there will be an introductory "pre-PSSL" afternoon of talks by Moritz Groth and Simon Henry, on the theme of higher category theory.

The seminar welcomes talks on topics related to any flavour of category theory and its applications, and it is in particular dedicated to PhD students and young researches.

Please let us know if you would like to participate and give a talk by providing an abstract on the website of the conference:

Brno is easily accessible from the UK with direct flights from London Stansted, and is also near to Vienna, Bratislava and Prague. Regular train connections depart from Prague and Vienna.

Further information about travel and accommodation will appear on the conference website, and we will send a second announcement soon with further details.

We hope to see you in Brno!
